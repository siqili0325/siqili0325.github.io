I am a Research Fellow at the [Digital Medicine Lab](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/). I earned my Ph.D. in Biostatistics and Health Data Science from Duke-NUS Medical School in March 2025, and my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in April 2021.

My research centers on federated and transfer learning for scalable AI in digital health and on developing innovative solutions for broader machine learning challenges. We welcome collaboration—if you’re interested in my work, our lab’s research, or internship [opportunities](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/opportunity/), please feel free to reach out.
