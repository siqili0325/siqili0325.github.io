Our method enables multiple sites to collaboratively perform MVI in a privacy-preserving manner, addressing challenges of data-sharing constraints and population heterogeneity.Methods:We begin by conducting MVI locally at each participating site, followed by the application of various FL strategies, ranging from basic to advanced, to federate local MVI models without sharing site-specific data. The federated model is then broadcast and used by each site for MVI. We evaluate FedIMPUTE using both simulation studies and a real-world application on electronic health records (EHRs) to predict emergency department (ED) outcomes as a proof of concept. Results:Simulation studies show that FedIMPUTE outperforms all baseline MVI methods under comparison, improving downstream prediction performance and effectively handling data heterogeneity across sites. By using ED datasets from three hospitals within the Duke University Health System (DUHS), FedIMPUTE achieves the lowest mean squared error (MSE) among benchmark MVI methods, indicating superior imputation accuracy. Additionally, FedIMPUTE provides good downstream prediction performance, outperforming or matching other benchmark methods.Conclusion:FedIMPUTE enhances the performance of downstream risk prediction tasks, particularly for sites with high missing data rates and small sample sizes. It is easy to implement and communication-efficient, requiring sites to share only non-patient-level summary statistics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="10.1371/journal.pdig.0000542" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Variable importance analysis with interpretable machine learning for fair risk prediction</div> <div class="author"> Yilin Ning, <em>Siqi Li</em>, Yih Yng Ng, Michael Yih Chong Chia, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 8 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '8 more authors' ?

The Shapley variable importance cloud (ShapleyVIC) addresses these limitations by assessing variable importance from an ensemble of regression models, which enhances robustness while maintaining interpretability, and estimates uncertainty of overall importance to formally test its significance. In a clinical study, ShapleyVIC reasonably identified important variables when the random forest and XGBoost failed to, and generally reproduced the findings from smaller subsamples (n = 2500 and 500) when statistical power of the logistic regression became attenuated. Moreover, ShapleyVIC reasonably estimated non-significant importance of race to justify its exclusion from the final prediction model, as opposed to the race-dependent model from the conventional stepwise model building. Hence, ShapleyVIC is robust and interpretable for variable importance assessment, with potential contribution to fairer clinical risk prediction.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="li2024bridging" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bridging Data Gaps in Healthcare: A Scoping Review of Transfer Learning in Biomedical Data Analysis</div> <div class="author"> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.11034</em>, Jul 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Clinical and biomedical research in low-resource settings often faces significant challenges due to the need for high-quality data with sufficient sample sizes to construct effective models. These constraints hinder robust model training and prompt researchers to seek methods for leveraging existing knowledge from related studies to support new research efforts. Transfer learning (TL), a machine learning technique, emerges as a powerful solution by utilizing knowledge from pre-trained models to enhance the performance of new models, offering promise across various healthcare domains. Despite its conceptual origins in the 1990s, the application of TL in medical research has remained limited, especially beyond image analysis. In our review of TL applications in structured clinical and biomedical data, we screened 3,515 papers, with 55 meeting the inclusion criteria. Among these, only 2% (one out of 55) utilized external studies, and 7% (four out of 55) addressed scenarios involving multi-site collaborations with privacy constraints. To achieve actionable TL with structured medical data while addressing regional disparities, inequality, and privacy constraints in healthcare research, we advocate for the careful identification of appropriate source data and models, the selection of suitable TL frameworks, and the validation of TL models with proper baselines.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="li2024developing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Developing Federated Time-to-Event Scores Using Heterogeneous Real-World Survival Data</div> <div class="author"> <em>Siqi Li</em>, Yuqing Shang, Ziwen Wang, Qiming Wu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

Scoring systems are widely used for swift and efficient risk prediction. However, existing methods for constructing survival scores presume that data originates from a single source, posing privacy challenges in collaborations with multiple data owners. We propose a novel framework for building federated scoring systems for multi-site survival outcomes, ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency. We applied our approach to sites with heterogeneous survival data originating from emergency departments in Singapore and the United States. Additionally, we independently developed local scores at each site. In testing datasets from each participant site, our proposed federated scoring system consistently outperformed all local models, evidenced by higher integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC) values, with a maximum improvement of 11.6%. Additionally, the federated score’s time-dependent AUC(t) values showed advantages over local scores, exhibiting narrower confidence intervals (CIs) across most time points. The model developed through our proposed method exhibits effective performance on each local site, signifying noteworthy implications for healthcare research. Sites participating in our proposed federated scoring model training gained benefits by acquiring survival models with enhanced prediction accuracy and efficiency. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our privacy-preserving federated survival score generation framework and its applicability to real-world heterogeneous survival data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="TEO2024101419" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Federated machine learning in healthcare: A systematic review on clinical applications and technical architecture</div> <div class="author"> Zhen Ling Teo, Liyuan Jin, Nan Liu, <em>Siqi Li</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 10 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '10 more authors' ?

By conducting a systematic review of FL applications in healthcare, we identify relevant articles in scientific, engineering, and medical journals in English up to August 31st, 2023. Out of a total of 22,693 articles under review, 612 articles are included in the final analysis. The majority of articles are proof-of-concepts studies, and only 5.2% are studies with real-life application of FL. Radiology and internal medicine are the most common specialties involved in FL. FL is robust to a variety of machine learning models and data types, with neural networks and medical imaging being the most common, respectively.

To systematically survey and analyze different reported cancer vaccines, we developed CanVaxKB (https://violinet.org/canvaxkb), the first web-based cancer vaccine knowledgebase that compiles over 670 therapeutic or preventive cancer vaccines that have been experimentally verified to be effective at various stages. Vaccine construction and host response data are also included. These cancer vaccines are developed against various cancer types such as melanoma, hematological cancer, and prostate cancer. CanVaxKB has stored 263 genes or proteins that serve as cancer vaccine antigen genes, which we have collectively termed ‘canvaxgens’. Top three mostly used canvaxgens are PMEL, MLANA and CTAG1B, often targeting multiple cancer types. A total of 193 canvaxgens are also reported in cancer-related ONGene, Network of Cancer Genes and/or Sanger Cancer Gene Consensus databases. Enriched functional annotations and clusters of canvaxgens were identified and analyzed. User-friendly web interfaces are searchable for querying and comparing cancer vaccines. CanVaxKB cancer vaccines are also semantically represented by the community-based Vaccine Ontology to support data exchange. Overall, CanVaxKB is a timely and vital cancer vaccine source that facilitates efficient collection and analysis, further helping researchers and physicians to better understand cancer mechanisms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="li2023federatedlearningclinicalstructured" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Federated Learning for Clinical Structured Data: A Benchmark Comparison of Engineering and Statistical Approaches</div> <div class="author"> <em>Siqi Li</em>, Di Miao, Qiming Wu, Chuan Hong, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

While the term “FL” was originally coined by the engineering community, the statistical field has also explored similar privacy-preserving algorithms. Statistical FL algorithms, however, remain considerably less recognized than their engineering counterparts. Our goal was to bridge the gap by presenting the first comprehensive comparison of FL frameworks from both engineering and statistical domains. We evaluated five FL frameworks using both simulated and real-world data. The results indicate that statistical FL algorithms yield less biased point estimates for model coefficients and offer convenient confidence interval estimations. In contrast, engineering-based methods tend to generate more accurate predictions, sometimes surpassing central pooled and statistical FL models. This study underscores the relative strengths and weaknesses of both types of methods, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and their integration in future FL applications.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="li2023fedscore" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">FedScore: A privacy-preserving framework for federated scoring system development</div> <div class="author"> <em>Siqi Li</em>, Yilin Ning, Marcus Eng Hock Ong, Bibhas Chakraborty, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Materials and methods The FedScore framework includes five modules: federated variable ranking, federated variable transformation, federated score derivation, federated model selection and federated model evaluation. To illustrate usage and assess FedScore’s performance, we built a hypothetical global scoring system for mortality prediction within 30 days after a visit to an emergency department using 10 simulated sites divided from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We employed a pre-existing score generator to construct 10 local scoring systems independently at each site and we also developed a scoring system using centralized data for comparison. Results We compared the acquired FedScore model’s performance with that of other scoring models using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The FedScore model achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.763 across all sites, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.020. We also calculated the average AUC values and SDs for each local model, and the FedScore model showed promising accuracy and stability with a high average AUC value which was closest to the one of the pooled model and SD which was lower than that of most local models.

Structured data, one of the most prevalent forms of clinical data, has experienced significant growth in volume concurrently, notably with the widespread adoption of electronic health records in clinical practice. This review examines FL applications on structured medical data, identifies contemporary limitations, and discusses potential innovations.We searched 5 databases, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify articles that applied FL to structured medical data and reported results following the PRISMA guidelines. Each selected publication was evaluated from 3 primary perspectives, including data quality, modeling strategies, and FL frameworks.Out of the 1193 papers screened, 34 met the inclusion criteria, with each article consisting of one or more studies that used FL to handle structured clinical/medical data. Of these, 24 utilized data acquired from electronic health records, with clinical predictions and association studies being the most common clinical research tasks that FL was applied to. Only one article exclusively explored the vertical FL setting, while the remaining 33 explored the horizontal FL setting, with only 14 discussing comparisons between single-site (local) and FL (global) analysis.The existing FL applications on structured medical data lack sufficient evaluations of clinically meaningful benefits, particularly when compared to single-site analyses. Therefore, it is crucial for future FL applications to prioritize clinical motivations and develop designs and methodologies that can effectively support and aid clinical practice and research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="LIU2023102587" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Handling missing values in healthcare data: A systematic review of deep learning-based imputation techniques</div> <div class="author"> Mingxuan Liu, <em>Siqi Li</em>, Han Yuan, Marcus Eng Hock Ong, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

In response to the increasing diversity and complexity of data, many researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based imputation techniques. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of these techniques, with a particular focus on the types of data, intending to assist healthcare researchers from various disciplines in dealing with missing data. Materials and methods We searched five databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus) for articles published prior to February 8, 2023 that described the use of DL-based models for imputation. We examined selected articles from four perspectives: data types, model backbones (i.e., main architectures), imputation strategies, and comparisons with non-DL-based methods. Based on data types, we created an evidence map to illustrate the adoption of DL models. Results Out of 1822 articles, a total of 111 were included, of which tabular static data (29%, 32/111) and temporal data (40%, 44/111) were the most frequently investigated. Our findings revealed a discernible pattern in the choice of model backbones and data types, for example, the dominance of autoencoder and recurrent neural networks for tabular temporal data. The discrepancy in imputation strategy usage among data types was also observed. The “integrated” imputation strategy, which solves the imputation task simultaneously with downstream tasks, was most popular for tabular temporal data (52%, 23/44) and multi-modal data (56%, 5/9). Moreover, DL-based imputation methods yielded a higher level of imputation accuracy than non-DL methods in most studies. Conclusion The DL-based imputation models are a family of techniques, with diverse network structures. Their designation in healthcare is usually tailored to data types with different characteristics. Although DL-based imputation models may not be superior to conventional approaches across all datasets, it is highly possible for them to achieve satisfactory results for a particular data type or dataset. There are, however, still issues with regard to portability, interpretability, and fairness associated with current DL-based imputation models.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="XIE2023102302" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A universal AutoScore framework to develop interpretable scoring systems for predicting common types of clinical outcomes</div> <div class="author"> Feng Xie, Yilin Ning, Mingxuan Liu, <em>Siqi Li</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 9 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '9 more authors' ?

We then explain how to iterate through steps for variable selection, score generation, fine-tuning, and evaluation to generate understandable and explainable scoring systems using data-driven evidence and clinical knowledge. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Xie et al. (2020),1 Xie et al. (2022)2, Saffari et al. (2022)3 and the online tutorial https://nliulab.github.io/AutoScore/.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="xie2022benchmarking" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Benchmarking emergency department prediction models with machine learning and public electronic health records</div> <div class="author"> Feng Xie, Jun Zhou, Jin Wee Lee, Mingrui Tan, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 9 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '9 more authors' ?

Clinical triage and risk assessment have become increasingly challenging due to the shortage of medical resources and the strain on hospital infrastructure caused by the pandemic. As a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs), we now have access to a vast amount of clinical data, which allows us to develop prediction models and decision support systems to address these challenges. To date, there is no widely accepted clinical prediction benchmark related to the ED based on large-scale public EHRs. An open-source benchmark data platform would streamline research workflows by eliminating cumbersome data preprocessing, and facilitate comparisons among different studies and methodologies. Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database, we created a benchmark dataset and proposed three clinical prediction benchmarks. This study provides future researchers with insights, suggestions, and protocols for managing data and developing predictive tools for emergency care.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ning2022novel" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A novel interpretable machine learning system to generate clinical risk scores: An application for predicting early mortality or unplanned readmission in a retrospective cohort study</div> <div class="author"> Yilin Ning, <em>Siqi Li</em>, Marcus Eng Hock Ong, Feng Xie, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Machine-learning-based methods may work well for identifying important predictors to create parsimonious scores, but such ‘black box’ variable selection limits interpretability, and variable importance evaluated from a single model can be biased. We propose a robust and interpretable variable selection approach using the recently developed Shapley variable importance cloud (ShapleyVIC) that accounts for variability in variable importance across models. Our approach evaluates and visualizes overall variable contributions for in-depth inference and transparent variable selection, and filters out non-significant contributors to simplify model building steps. We derive an ensemble variable ranking from variable contributions across models, which is easily integrated with an automated and modularized risk score generator, AutoScore, for convenient implementation. In a study of early death or unplanned readmission after hospital discharge, ShapleyVIC selected 6 variables from 41 candidates to create a well-performing risk score, which had similar performance to a 16-variable model from machine-learning-based ranking. Our work contributes to the recent emphasis on interpretability of prediction models for high-stakes decision making, providing a disciplined solution to detailed assessment of variable importance and transparent development of parsimonious clinical risk scores.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ang2022development" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Development and validation of an interpretable clinical score for early identification of acute kidney injury at the emergency department</div> <div class="author"> Yukai Ang, <em>Siqi Li</em>, Marcus Eng Hock Ong, Feng Xie, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

Clinical risk scores can be used for the early identification of patients at risk of AKI. We conducted a retrospective study using electronic health records of Singapore General Hospital emergency department patients who were admitted from 2008 to 2016. The primary outcome was inpatient AKI of any stage within 7 days of admission based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines. A machine learning-based framework AutoScore was used to generate clinical scores from the study sample which was randomly divided into training, validation and testing cohorts. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC). Among the 119,468 admissions, 10,693 (9.0%) developed AKI. 8491 were stage 1 (79.4%), 906 stage 2 (8.5%) and 1296 stage 3 (12.1%). The AKI Risk Score (AKI-RiSc) was a summation of the integer scores of 6 variables: serum creatinine, serum bicarbonate, pulse, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age. AUC of AKI-RiSc was 0.730 (95% CI 0.714–0.747), outperforming an existing AKI Prediction Score model which achieved AUC of 0.665 (95% CI 0.646–0.679) on the testing cohort. At a cut-off of 4 points, AKI-RiSc had a sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 46.7%. AKI-RiSc is a simple clinical score that can be easily implemented on the ground for early identification of AKI and potentially be applied in international settings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li>
